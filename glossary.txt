'stroke': equivalent to a brushstroke, the alteration of the canvas element's
    contents over the course of one depression of the mouse button (or
    equivalent). The under lying structure of a stroke is a sequence of points
    with a line segment connecting each neighboring (in time) pair.
'stroke point': a point in the canvas space the pointer occupies at some moment
    during a stroke. A stroke always starts and ends with a point (perhaps the
    same). Has x and y coordinates.
'stroke segment': a line segment connecting two stroke points, thereby
    representing a subpath of a stroke. Defined by their start and end points.
    Has an angle.
'angle': an absolute angle measured on the unit circle in radians, except the
    unit circle is flipped vertically because the y-axis is flipped in the
    canvas element.
'stroke skeleton': points, segments, and any other geometric structure derived from
    them that are not intended to be rendered during normal usage and which
    provide the structure of a stroke.
'stroke bone': an element of the skeleton
'wings': bones consisting of two small line segments perpendicular to the
    segment angles (or point angles, themselves derived from segment angles)
'wingtip': the end of a wing which is not on its segment
